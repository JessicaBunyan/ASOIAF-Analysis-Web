    "Daenerys relates to Xaro Xhoan Daxos how the Pureborn have denied her, despite all the customary bribes and traditional proceedings she followed. Daenerys' hope of obtaining ships and men from the Pureborn was in vain, and now she has to move on. The Pureborn are interested only in her dragons, not in her cause. She again beseeches Xaro for ships, but the merchant prince tells her he has no warships. He asks her again to marry him, and she again refuses. She considers going to the Warlocks for aid, and again Xaro warns her not to. As they move through the marketplace, Daenerys witnesses a firemage make a ladder of fire and climb it into the sky, as cutpurses move through the astonished crowd. Xaro declares the feat a fine trick, but Quaithe appears and tells them it was no trick. ",
    "The shadowbinder tells Daenerys that half a year ago, the man could scarcely make even a small fire appear, but his power has grown now, and all because of Daenerys, the Mother of Dragons. Quaithe warns, \"You must leave this city soon…or you will never be permitted to leave it at all.\" Daenerys realizes that Quaithe wants her to go to Asshai, and when she asks why, the shadowbinder tells her it is there she will find truth. Her khas warn her not to trust the Asshai’i shadowbinder, and Xaro concurs. Later, Ser Jorah tells her she will find no help in this city. He explains why Xaro wants to marry her: During a Qartheen wedding ceremony, the bride and groom each ask one thing from each other that the other cannot refuse. Ser Jorah is convinced that Xaro plans to obtain one of her dragons in this way. He tells her she should go east, but not to Asshai. When Daenerys suggests returning west to Illyrio, Jorah warns her that the Magister cares only for himself and would provide no help. Daenerys believes he will give her the ships and soldiers to retake Westeros, but Jorah states, \"Nothing knits a broken realm together so quick as an invading army on its soil.” ",
    "He reminds her that a man was sent to kill her when Robert Baratheon heard that she was pregnant, and fears what might happen when word spreads of her dragons. Daenerys wonders why the comet led her to Qarth if not to obtain ships and an army, and Ser Jorah implores her to go to Pyat Pree for help. "
