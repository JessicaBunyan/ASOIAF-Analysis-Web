    "Tyrion dispatches his clansmen into the kingswood to raid Stannis's baggage trains, ambush his scouts, and perform night raids. Tyrion feels he can trust only about a quarter of the 6,000 men in the City Watch, and feels unprepared for the coming battle. He orders Bronn to start burning down the houses along the wall by the quay, feeling that the enemy could scale the wall easier by climbing on the roofs of the houses. Tyrion is aware that Winterfell has fallen to the ironmen. Balon Swann has been named to the Kingsguard to replace Preston Greenfield, and Tyrion approves, but he does not approve of Cersei’s choice of Osmund Kettleblack to replace Boros Blount. Blount was stripped of his white cloak after he surrendered Tommen immediately when Jacelyn’s men overtook them. Blount is rotting in Rosby’s dungeon on the count of treason, since the Kingsguard are supposed to give their lives in defending the royal family. ",
    "Tyrion has appointed the new High Septon, and tells him to warn the people that Stannis means to burn the Great Sept of Baelor. Tyrion is also visited by Hallyne the Pyromancer from the Alchemists' Guild, and is surprised to learn that they have 13,000 jars of wildfire, way ahead of schedule. When Tyrion asks why, the pyromancer explains that their spells have been more potent of late, but is at a loss to explain why. He does ask Tyrion if there are any dragons about, and elaborates something he heard a long time ago, that magic began to disappear from the world when the last dragon died. ",
    "Jacelyn informs Tyrion that Tommen is safe, but the Hand does not know where the boy is being kept in case Tyrion is captured and tortured by the invaders. Varys then informs Tyrion of a plot by several merchants calling themselves Antler Men to arm commoners in the streets. Tyrion writes the order for their arrest, one of them being the master smith Salloreon. "
