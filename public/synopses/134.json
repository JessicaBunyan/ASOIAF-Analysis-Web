    "Tyrion, with Ser Balon Swann and Ser Mandon Moore at his side, is cutting through Stannis’s forces. He is confused to see such a large force of men to the west, seemingly fighting Stannis’s men, and can’t figure out where they came from. But he has little time to consider it, as he sees hundreds of Stannis’s troops crossing the Blackwater by using the half-sunk ships as a bridge. Racing onto the boats, Tyrion’s men are overwhelmed, and he goes over the edge of a gunwale, clinging for his life. Ser Mandon Moore appears and tells Tyrion to take his hand, his left hand. As Tyrion reaches for his hand, he instinctively withdraws as Ser Mandon’s sword slices into his face. Tyrion, grievously wounded, watches as Podrick Payne saves his life by shoving Ser Mandon into the river. "
