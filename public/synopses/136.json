    "Dany considers the defeat of the Undying to be Drogon’s victory. However, Xaro, whose guest she is, warns her that the Warlocks are gathering their power to come for her, and that the other two great merchant consortiums want her either expelled from the city, or killed outright. Dany realizes she must flee, for Xaro’s protection can only go so far. The merchant again asks her to marry him, but this time Dany learns that what Xaro really wants is one of the dragons. Dany tells him that it would cost one-third of all the ships in the world in order for her to give up one of her dragons. Xaro leaves, and Dany questions Ser Jorah about some of the mysteries she saw in the House of the Undying. Jorah says that the three heads of the dragon represent Aegon and his two sisters, but Dany is not convinced. The knight confirms that Rhaegar did play a silver harp, but he says that if the Prince’s son was the promised one in the vision, the infant Aegon was killed during the sack of King's Landing. Jorah has no knowledge of the song of ice and fire. ",
    "Dany later sets out with the exiled knight and her bloodriders to find ships to take her from Qarth. Along the docks, Jorah warns her that a big, scarred man and an old man with a staff are following them. When a merchant hands her a beautiful box as a gift, Dany opens it to find a green scarab within. The creature within the box flies out, and mayhem erupts. The creature would have bit Dany had the old man with the staff not knocked it out of her hands. The merchant was a Sorrowful Man, and the creature a manticore that would have killed Dany had it bitten her. They learn that the huge, scarred eunuch is the pit-fighter Strong Belwas, and the old man is his squire Arstan Whitebeard, both sent by Magister Illyrio Mopatis to return them to Pentos. The old man recognizes Mormont, and the exile recognizes him but cannot place a name. Arstan claims he comes from the Seven Kingdoms, and squired for a knight of House Swann as a young man. The two claim that Illyrio sent for them because he wishes to have her dragons in order to bring justice to the Seven Kingdoms, which are a divided and warring realm. Dany concedes that she must leave Qarth, but commands them to change the names of their three ships to that of Aegon’s three dragons. "
