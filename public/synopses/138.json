    "Sansa watches the long procession of heroes and captives being presented before the King. Tywin Lannister is now Hand, and many are rewarded for their service to House Lannister during the Battle of the Blackwater, with over 600 new knights made. Ser Loras Tyrell is named a member of Joffrey’s Kingsguard, and Margaery is betrothed to Joffrey. With this, Sansa's betrothal to Joffrey is ended, to her great relief. Mace Tyrell is named to the King’s small council. ",
    "Many of the great lords sworn to Casterly Rock and Highgarden receive honors, and many hedge knights and freeriders as well. Lothor Brune is knighted, and called Apple-Eater for defeating several Fossoways; Philip Foote is granted the lands of Lord Bryce Caron and elevated to lord. Hallyne the Pyromancer is named lord, but given no lands, and Lancel is named lord and given the land of the Darrys, except he may die or lose his arm from the wounds he suffered. Littlefinger is granted Harrenhal and named Lord Paramount of the Trident for negotiating the treaty which brought the Tyrells to the aid of King's Landing. ",
    "When the captives are brought in, many swear fealty to Joffrey, but several are killed for openly ridiculing the King and refusing to bend the knee. Later that night, Sansa goes to the godswood and meets Dontos Hollard, who is sad because the Queen still has plans for Sansa, and her escape will be impossible while the Queen is watching. However, Dontos does reveal that they will escape during Joffrey’s wedding in about a month. Dontos then gives her a hair net that resembles a silver spiderweb with amethysts in it. He tells her to wear it, for \"It’s magic, you see. It’s justice you hold. It’s vengeance for your father. It’s home.\" "
