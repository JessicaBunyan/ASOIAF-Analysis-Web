    "Jojen wakes Bran from a wolf dream, and warns him that he's spending too much time as Summer, and that while the wolf eats in the dreams, Bran does not. Bran informs them that Winterfell has been burned to the ground and is all ash except for the stone walls. They have been hiding in the crypts all this time. Trusting Bran’s vision, they decide it is now safe to come out of hiding. Hodor moves a massive stone blocking off the door out of the crypts, and they indeed find Winterfell in ashes. They find several of Theon’s ironmen dead, along with men bearing the badge of the Dreadfort. ",
    "The direwolves rejoin them, and lead them to Maester Luwin who lies near death in the godswood, which is still largely untouched. Jojen says, \"There is power in living wood, a power strong as fire.\" The maester is thankful that the boys are still alive, although he knew that Theon had killed the miller’s boys from their looks, but had never revealed his knowledge to Theon. Maester Luwin admits that he is dying, and provides his last advice. He tells Osha not to send the boys off together, they are Robb’s heirs and must be separated. Osha asks him where to bring the boys, but Luwin is unsure, with the ironmen to the west, the Bastard of Bolton to the east, and war everywhere, \"each man against his neighbor, and winter is coming…such folly, such black mad folly…\" Maester Luwin tells Bran to be strong, that he is his father’s son. He then asks a boon of Osha, and the wildling woman sends the others away. When she returns, it is decided that Bran will go north in search of the crow with Jojen, Meera, Hodor and Summer, while Osha will take Rickon and Shaggydog south, perhaps to White Harbor. As Bran looks upon Winterfell for perhaps the last time, he thinks to himself, The stone is strong, the roots of the trees go deep, and under the ground the Kings of Winter sit their thrones. It is not dead, just broken. much like Bran himself. "
