    "Bronn visits Tyrion, who is recovering from his wounds. He finds that much has changed in King's Landing under his father’s rule. He also realizes that his father has seen to it that Tyrion received little of the credit for saving the city. Bronn has been knighted, and now goes by Ser Bronn of the Blackwater. Lord Jacelyn Bywater was killed by his own men during the Battle of the Blackwater, and Ser Addam Marbrand was named Commander of the City Watch. Cersei has returned Tommen to the city, and the Kettleblacks, now all knights, are no longer working for Tyrion. His cousin Tyrek still has not been found, and is feared dead. Additionally, Tyrion's mountain clansmen have been chased out of the city. Some remain in the kingswood, but others return to the Vale. Tyrion asks Bronn to learn more about Ser Mandon Moore, trying to discover if his sister sent the Kingsguard to kill him. ",
    "Tyrion forces himself to dress and visit his father, despite his near captivity in Maegor's Holdfast by his sister. Lord Tywin reveals that some battles are won by quills and ravens, and is in the process of composing letters. The Hand tells his son that Ser Helman Tallhart and Robett Glover are marching on Duskendale, but he has sent Lord Randyll Tarly and Ser Gregor to deal with them. Tyrion seeks a little gratitude from his father, but Lord Tywin tells him, \"Mummers and monkeys require applause.\" Tyrion states that he wants Casterly Rock, as he is heir by rights since Jaime is a sworn brother of the Kingsguard. Tywin will never let Tyrion have the Lannisters’s ancestral seat, however, and warns him that he will hang the next whore Tyrion takes to bed. ",
