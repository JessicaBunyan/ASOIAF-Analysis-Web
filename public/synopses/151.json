    "Illyrioâ€™s three ships are sailing for Pentos, and Daenerys is watching her dragons fly over the ocean. Arstan tells her that Balerion was 200 years old when he died during the reign of King Jaehaerys the Conciliator. Arstan then speaks of Rhaegar, how bookish he was as a child, always reading. Then one day he read something in a scroll that made him want to be a warrior, and he began training fiercely. Arstan admits that Rhaegar was a great warrior, but he won no battles. ",
    "Later, Jorah tells her that Arstan is more than he seems, and warns her not to trust him. The knight advises her to sail for Astapor and buy Unsullied, the best trained fighting force in the world. He tells the tale of the Three Thousand of Qohor, where a small army of Unsullied defeated a huge khalasar trying to pillage Qohor. The Unsullied are eunuch slaves trained to obey orders absolutely, and they feel no pain. Daenerys agrees that she will force Captain Groleo and Strong Belwas to change course. Ser Jorah then grabs her by the waist and kisses her. Dany tells him he should not have done so, but Jorah talks of her vision in the House of the Undying, and how the dragon having three heads may mean that she should take two more husbands. ",
