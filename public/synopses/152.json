    "While hiding in the Tumbledown Tower, Bran gains the ability to open his third eye at will, and become Summer. Jojen again warns him not to spend too much time as Summer, neglecting his body and forgetting what he should do when in contact with his direwolf. They have been traveling north; staying away from civilization for fear that Bran might be seen, especially by the ironmen or Bolton men.
