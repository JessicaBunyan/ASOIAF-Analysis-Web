The innkeep mentions the Lightning Lord, and we learn that Lord Beric and Thoros are still together raiding in the Riverlands. The innkeep recommends they abandon their skiff and ride for King's Landing. Brienne buys the inn's horses for three gold and their skiff, getting robbed blind according to Jaime.

He was waiting on the Iron Throne to see who would come to claim the kingdom, but it was Eddard Stark who found him there.
