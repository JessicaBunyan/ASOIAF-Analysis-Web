They are discovered by three men: Tom of Sevenstreams, Lem and Anguy. The men say they are Kingsmen and ask them to come with them to a nearby inn. Arya hesitates but after Anguy shows how skilled he is with the bow she realizes that they stand no chance and she agrees. ",
    "At the inn Gendry remains in the stable to watch their horses although Tom assures them that they are safe. Arya and Hot Pie enter the inn with the three men. The atmosphere is friendly. The men talk with the innkeeper and his wife about the food and the last visitors of the inn. The innkeeper sold them horses and gave them directions. Tom and his friends were waiting for them to get the horses back but they did not see them. ",
