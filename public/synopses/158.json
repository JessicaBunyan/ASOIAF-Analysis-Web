    "Jon is observing Mance's host, taking note of all the giants and mammoths that make up the army. Tormund is telling Jon some tall tales about himself, when the eagle that was once Orell rakes Jon's face. Rattleshirt has arrived to bring Jon before Mance, this time at the Fist of the First Men. The king confronts Jon about how many men were at the Fist, and who led. Jon, seeing how many of the Watch died here and realizing Mance may kill him for lying, tells the truth. The situation is still tense. Jon feels that Mance may still have him killed because Jon lied to him previously. Briefly he thinks about attacking Mance but Ygritte saves him by telling them that they are lovers. The wildlings respect any man who steals his woman, and Rayder informs Jon that he will be leaving with Styr and Jarl on the morrow to climb the Wall. That night, Jon and Ygritte share a bed together. ",
