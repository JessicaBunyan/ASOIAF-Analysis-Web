    "The brotherhood without banners searches for Beric Dondarrion, and Arya Stark sees the ghost of High Heart. ",
    "The outlaws first visit Lord Lymond Lychester and then the Lady of the Leaves in search of word on Lord Beric Dondarrion's whereabouts. But none have seen him, only hearing rumors that he was dead—hanged once, killed by Vargo Hoat, Amory Lorch, and twice by Gregor Clegane. Arya heard similar rumors at Harrenhal, but Lem and Tom know that Beric is still alive. ",
    "The outlaws plan to ransom Arya at Riverrun after they meet up with Beric and Thoros of Myr. They arrive at High Heart, an ancient hill sacred to the children of the forest. Thirty-one mighty weirwoods had stood at the top of the hill, but only their stumps remained from after the Andals chopped them down. Arya can still feel the power of the place. An old dwarf woman speaks in private to Lem, Tom, and Greenbeard, but Arya overhears the conversation. The woman has dreams while sleeping among the weirwood stumps, and tells them she had dreamed of \"a shadow with a burning heart killing a golden stag\";[1] of \"a man without a face, waiting on a swaying bridge, on his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from its wings\";[2] and of \"a raging river and a woman that was a fish…dead with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, I woke from terror.\"[3] ",
    "At Acorn Hall, Lady Smallwood informs them that Thoros had been through recently, and that Karstark men were searching for the Kingslayer. Arya and Gendry go off to the smithy, and the former apprentice explains that Thoros was a charlatan, using regular swords with wildfire to make his flaming sword. ",
