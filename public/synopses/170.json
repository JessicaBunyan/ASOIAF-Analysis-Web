    "Daenerys tells the slavers that she wants all eight thousand Unsullied, plus all the slave boys in training, whether they've been cut yet or not. In order to pay the slave masters, Daenerys offers all three of her ships as well as Drogon, for the price of a dragon is incalculable. Daenerys frees Missandei and takes her into her service, revealing that she can speak High Valyrian. We learn that Valar Morghulis means 'all men must die'. ",
    "That night, Quaithe appears to Daenerys, seemingly in a dream, telling her again, \"To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward you must go back, and to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.\" When the time for the deal to be brokered arrives, Daenerys swings the slaver's whip in Kraznys' face, and releases Drogon on him, shouting, \"Drogon! Dracarys!\" This is the sign for her followers to attack the slavers. With the help of the Unsullied who obey her as she is now their owner she has the slavers killed. The other slaves join her and soon Astapor is conquered. "
