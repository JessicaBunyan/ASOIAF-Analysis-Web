    "Sansa is dressing in the gown Cersei had made for her, thinking to herself what it would be like to marry Willas Tyrell. However, her daydreams are shattered when the Queen reveals that she is to marry Tyrion that very afternoon. Sansa does her duty, realizing there is no way out. Tyrion apologizes to her, saying that it was his fatherâ€™s wish to see them wed. During the ceremony, Sansa does not bend to allow Tyrion to place his cloak over her shoulders, causing embarrasment for the dwarf. At the feast, Garlan comforts Sansa, saying that Tyrion will make a good husband, \"He is a bigger man than he seems.\" When the time comes to have them bedded, Tyrion demands that there will be no bedding. He has to threaten Joffrey to keep him from making the tense moment worse. In bed that night, Tyrion realizes that Sansa is petrified at the thought of losing her maidenhood to him, and he tells her that he will not touch her until she wants him to. "
