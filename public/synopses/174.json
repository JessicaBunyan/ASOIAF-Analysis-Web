    "On the way to Harrenhal, Jaime's wound is infected, and he is feverish from the loss of his hand (which has been cut off by Zollo). At the camp some of the Bloody Mummers come to rape Brienne. Jaime knows that if she resists they will probably kill her so he advises her to take her mind far away. He recalls that when Aerys cooked Lord Rickard Stark alive while Brandon died trying to rescue him, Jaime did the same. Brienne is stubborn and wants to resist. Jaime saves her again by yelling “sapphires” loud enough for the Goat to hear. Brienne thanks him as Jaime considers the debt (revenge) that he owes to Vargo Hoat and his Bloody Mummers: a Lannister always pays his debts. ",
    "After reaching Harrenhal, Hoat presents the Kingslayer to Roose Bolton, who is disgusted that the Mummers hacked off his hand. He has Qyburn cleanse the stump and bandage it. Jaime asks Qyburn to see to Brienne's wounds as well. ",
