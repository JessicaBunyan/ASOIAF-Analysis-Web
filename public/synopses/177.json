    "Arya and Gendry are blindfolded until they reach the hollow hill, the secret base of the forgotten fellowship. Sandor Clegane is brought bound before Thoros of Myr, and Arya cannot believe how different the red priest looks. The Hound is to be judged by Beric Dondarrion and hanged if found guilty. Thoros is a changed man, no longer a fat priest with a fake flaming sword, saying, \"I am not the false priest you knew. The Lord of Light has woken in my soul. Many powers long asleep are waking, and there are forces moving in the land.\" ",
    "When Dondarrion appears, Arya is appalled by his appearance. Once handsome, the man is now stick thin, missing an eye, with part of his skull crushed in, a noose scar around his neck, and a terrible wound through his chest. Dondarrion asks for charges to be made against Sandor, but the Hound spits at the accusations, laying them at the feet of his brother and others. But Arya accuses him of killing Mycah, and the Hound does not refute that. The Lightning Lord sentences him to trial by battle, and it will be Dondarrion he faces. Before the fight, Thoros says a prayer to R'hllor, and then Dondarrion cuts open his palm with his sword, causing the blade to take fire. ",
    "The fight ends with Cleganeâ€™s shield destroyed and his left arm in flames, but the Hound cuts Dondarrion from shoulder to breastbone. Sandor is screaming in pain and fear from the hideous burn to his arm. When Arya confronts him about Mycah, Clegane admits killing the boy, and suddenly Dondarrion appears, alive and leaning against Thoros, to tell Sandor he has gone to hell. "
