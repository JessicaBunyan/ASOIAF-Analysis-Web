    "Tyrion has been sent to greet the three hundred Dornishmen with a small retinue. However, he is shocked when he finds that the Dornishmen are being led by Prince Oberyn Martell and not his brother, Prince Doran. The Red Viper of Dorne has an infamous reputation for using poisoned weapons in battle. The man fought in the Free Cities and even formed his own sellsword company, he studied at the Citadel for a time, and most importantly, he crippled Willas Tyrell in a tourney. Though this was years ago, it has never been forgotten by the Tyrells, who will not be happy that this man is attending the marriage of one of them. ",
    "The Red Viper tells Tyrion the story of how he and Elia traveled to Casterly Rock when Tyrion was an infant. It was just after the death of Joanna Lannister. Tywin Lannister was in mourning and ignored the Martells. Oberyn and Elia were disappointed to find out that Tyrion was only a dwarf, after the stories they had heard about him being Tywinâ€™s monster son. The Red Viper then gets down to the point, asking Tyrion, \"when will justice be served?\" He warns Tyrion that he does not mean to stop after killing Gregor Clegane: \"Before he dies, the Enormity that Rides will tell me whence came his orders, please assure your lord father of that.\" But Tyrion has a more subtle warning: The Lannisters have tens of thousands of Tyrell men present as allies. And the Tyrells hate the Dornish, and especially Prince Oberyn for what he did to Willas. ",
