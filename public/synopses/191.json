    "Jon Snow reaches Mole's Town and warns the populace to evacuate. At Castle Black, Jon learns that Jarman Buckwell and his men have returned with tidings of Mance Rayder’s army. He discovers that the wildlings have been feinting all along the Wall, and groups of black brothers have been dispersed to counter them. Maester Aemon also tells him that Jeor Mormont was betrayed and killed, and that only twelve men made it back from Craster's Keep, including Giant, Grenn, Dywen, Sweet Donnel Hill and Dolorous Edd. Aemon cleans and wraps Jon’s wound, and Grenn tells him that Winterfell has been burned to the ground and that Bran and Rickon Stark are dead at the hands of Theon Greyjoy. Jon tells them that there is some kind of mistake, for he saw a grey direwolf at Queenscrown. Jon wonders if Bran lives on through his direwolf. ",
