    "At an unnamed inn on the road to King's Landing, Jaime hears that the king is dead, his firstborn son, but he is more concerned about Cersei. Jaime and Brienne have already learned of Robb Stark’s demise, and found out that Lord Clement Piper rode to King’s Landing to bend the knee since his son Marq is held captive at the Twins. When they arrive at the Red Keep, Ser Loras confronts Brienne, accusing her of killing Renly. Jaime reminds the Knight of Flowers that he is his Lord Commander and orders him to sheathe his sword, but has Brienne arrested and taken to a tower cell. ",
    "Jaime finds Cersei in the castle sept, where Joffrey is lying in state, and shows her his stump. She asks him to kill Tyrion for murdering Joffrey. Despite Cersei’s words that Tyrion threatened her when she held Alayaya prisoner, Jaime tells her he wishes to learn more about what happened. He has sex with her on the Mother's altar, and afterwards Cersei calls it folly, saying that they must be more careful with their father in the castle. He responds that they should stop hiding their love and wed, even if Tommen would lose the Iron Throne, he would still be heir to Casterly Rock, but she sends him away in anger. ",
    "Jaime then visits his father, and Lord Tywin is furious when he learns that Vargo Hoat maimed his son. The Hand of the King reveals that the Bloody Mummers were routed at Harrenhal, and that Gregor Clegane will kill the Goat soon but is using him for amusement in the meantime. Tywin then speaks of his plans to bribe the High Septon to release Jaime of his vows to the Kingsguard, find a new husband for Cersei, and perhaps marry Jaime to Margaery. Jaime vehemently refuses to hear of it, stating that he is a knight of the Kingsguard, and that’s all he means to be. Lord Tywin turns from his son in disgust, saying, \"You are not my son. You say you are Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Very well, ser. Go do your duty.\" "
