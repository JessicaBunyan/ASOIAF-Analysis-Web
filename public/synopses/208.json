    "Arya dreams that she is running with a pack of wolves every night, but by day she is still Sandor’s captive. The Hound hit her with the flat of his axe to keep her from entering the Twins. Sandor now intends to take her to the Eyrie and ransom her to Lady Lysa. That night, Arya dreams the wolf dream again, and she watches as the other wolves feast on corpses by the river. She follows a scent that leads her to her mother’s body, and pulls it from the river. Looking at the corpse, Arya’s wolf-self thinks \"Rise. Rise and eat and run with us.\" Then, the pack notices men approaching and flees. Arya wakes up. At some point they encounter a survivor from the Red Wedding, a bowman in service to Ser Marq Piper. The man is injured, and they give him water, then Sandor gives him the gift of mercy. Later, she and Sandor take on work in a village in the foothill of the Mountains of the Moon, and learn that the Vale mountain clans have grown bolder and now carry steel. Realizing they will never reach the Eyrie, Clegane decides to head back to Riverrun and attempt to ransom Arya to the Blackfish. Arya tells the Hound that he has lost his belly for fighting since he ran from the Battle of the Blackwater, but he just laughs at her. ",
