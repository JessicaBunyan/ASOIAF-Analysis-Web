    "Mance’s raiders advance under the protection of a giant fortified turtle but the Night's Watch is able to destroy it. Afterwards, Jon tries to get some sleep, but is pulled out of bed by some men from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. They bring him before Alliser Thorne, and his new friend Janos Slynt. The two accuse Jon of being a turncloak and oathbreaker, and they even use the captured Rattleshirt to support their accusations. Even Maester Aemon cannot persuade Slynt to relent, and the former Commander of the City Watch has Jon thrown into an ice cell, relishing the thought of punishing one of Ned Stark’s sons. "
