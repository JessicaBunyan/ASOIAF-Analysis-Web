    "Jon is training with Satin in the yard, when Melisandre arrives to take him before Stannis. The King does not believe Jon is a traitor, for he knew Janos Slynt as well as Ned Stark. Stannis knew Ned to be a man of honor, and trusts Jon, saying it was Jon who found the dragonglass dagger that Samwell Tarly used to kill the Other, and Jon who brought them the Horn of Winter and captured Manceâ€™s son. At every step of Stannis' speech, Jon clarifies whom he credits with doing the actual deeds. Stannis asks Jon if there is honor in Mance Rayder, and the young man claims there is. The King speaks of the war that Melisandre has seen in her flames, and he confides that Jon may have a part in the upcoming battle. Stannis offers to legitimize Jon and name him Lord of Winterfell, a goal he considers especially important due to all the strife occurring in the North. Stannis intends to let the wildlings through the Wall, and settle them in the Gift, should they pledge fealty and accept the Lord of Light as their god. He also presumes to marry his loyal Lord of Winterfell to Val to solidify his peace with the wildlings, however Jon would have to adopt Stannis' faith and burn the godswood of Winterfell. Jon asks for time to consider the offer, and Stannis agrees. ",
