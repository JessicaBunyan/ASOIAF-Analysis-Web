    "Reaching the camps besieging Riverrun, Jaime meets with his cousin Ser Daven. The new Warden of the West spits when he discovers that it was Vargo Hoat who had Jaime's hand amputated, informing him that he offered Tywin to forage for Hoat, but he refused, saying that some tasks are fit for lions, but foraging is best left for goats and dogs. ",
    "Daven reveals how much the Freys are vexing him, and even their own uncle Emmon Frey is trying his patience, complaining that he doesn't want his new seat destroyed by a siege. Worst of all is Ser Ryman, who keeps tying a noose around Edmure Tully's neck each morning threatening the Blackfish that he means to hang him unless Riverrun surrenders; however, the Blackfish has long exposed Ryman's threat to be empty. ",
    "They speak of Lancel and his abandonment of Darry, which reminds Jaime of the looks on Ami's family's faces when Lancel made his intentions clear. He is all too aware of how Lord Walder deals with those who break Frey marriage proposals. Daven tells the Lord Commander that their uncle Kevan passed through the camps heading west. He also mentions that Edmure's wife Roslin is pregnant, and oddly she is fond of the dispossessed Lord of Riverrun. He also tells Jaime of Lord Gawen Westerling constantly hounding him to rescue his wife and children, who are being held captive by Ser Brynden Tully. ",
    "Jaime is perturbed to learn how little help they are receiving from the bannermen of the Tullys who bent the knee to the Iron Throne after the Red Wedding. He realizes that he must secure Riverrun quickly to put down any threat of rebellion. Starving them out would take far too long. ",
    "The next morning, Jaime is considering a parley with Ser Brynden, and recalls when he was a squire of Sumner Crakehall, sent to Riverrun with a message. Lord Hoster seated Jaime next to Lysa, but the young man was far more interested in Lysa's famous uncle, the Blackfish. Within sight of the walls of Riverrun, Jaime has his tent pitched, and soon receives a visit from his Aunt Genna and her husband, Emmon Frey. ",
    "Genna is still a Lannister through-and-through, with the wit and sharp tongue also shared by all of Lord Tywin's children. Jaime lies to them that their son Cleos died bravely, and then listens to Emmon's complaints about a siege damaging his castle. Jaime enlightens Emmon to the fact that he was named Lord of Riverrun, but Petyr Baelish is the Lord Paramount of the Trident. Emmon is outraged to learn he is a vassal of Petyr, but Jaime is unconcerned, as there is nothing he can do about it and Cersei won't indulge someone like Emmon Frey. Genna tells Emmon to leave so she can speak in private with her nephew. ",
    "Lady Genna makes it known how she feels about Queen Cersei rearming the Faith (namely that the decision is idiotic, given the trouble the Faith Militant caused the Targaryens before they were finally put down and disbanded), Cersei's choice of councillors, in particular rejecting her brother Kevan as Hand, and Lancel's foolish decision to leave behind his lordship. When Jaime remarks that he plans to treat with Ser Brynden, his aunt tells him that he would be better off beheading Edmure. But Jaime feels this may further the Blackfish's resolve, and would sooner assault the walls of Riverrun if a parley will not work. ",
    "At last, they discuss Lord Tywin, and Jaime asks her if she loved her eldest brother. Lady Genna tells him how it was Tywin, a boy of only ten, who objected to their lord father's decision to wed the seven year old Genna to Emmon Frey, who was not even the heir to the Twins. For that alone, she loved him, stating, \"...every little girl needs a big brother to protect her. Who will protect us now?\" ",
    "When Jaime insists that he is his father's son, his aunt replies, \"You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there's some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but Tyrion is Tywin's son, not you.\" "
