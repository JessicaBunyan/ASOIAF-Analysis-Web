    "As dawn breaks Tyrion awakes to find the litter has stopped. He meets Haldon Halfmaester and Ser Rolly Duckfield, who take on supplies from Illyrio before leaving with Tyrion. Illyrio tells them the dwarf's name is Yollo, although Tyrion, misliking the name, claims it is his name in Pentos and his name is Hugor Hill. The pair tease Tyrion with tales of river pirates and the Shrouded Lord. Tyrion and Haldon test each others' book knowledge while Duck recounts the events that led to his knighting at the hands of Griff and his unusual name. They ride until they reach the Little Rhoyne at Ghoyan Drohe, where a poleboat, the Shy Maid, is waiting for them. ",
    "On board are the boy, Young Griff, and his father, Griff. The older man reads a letter sent to him by Illyrio, telling of Tyrion's murder of his father. Griff is mistrustful and Tyrion is convinced he is no ordinary sellsword - he can read, and he is a knight, having knighted Duck himself. Tyrion promises to serve Daenerys Targaryen faithfully, but asks \"What if we should find the queen and discover that this talk of dragons was just some sailor's drunken fancy? This wide world is full of such mad tales. Grumkins and snarks, ghosts and ghouls, mermaids, rock goblins, winged horses, winged pigs...winged lions.\" Griff tells him to guard his tongue or lose it.
