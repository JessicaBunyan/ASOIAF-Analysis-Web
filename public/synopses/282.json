    "There have been more murders by the Harpy's Sons on the streets of Meereen. This time they involved an attack on fully-armed Unsullied in pairs. Nine died, including one of Missandei's brothers, Mossador. Once again, Daenerys orders an investigation, permitting Skahaz mo Kandaq to torture a wineseller when she discovers that three freedmen were among the slain. Furious, Dany orders the Unsullied to restrict themselves to patrolling the walls, and imposes a blood tax on the great families of Meereen to fund a new mixed force of freedmen and shavepates to patrol the city streets under the control of Skahaz. The families of Zhak and Merreq are preparing to leave the city; the Queen orders that their wealth must remain behind, as well as some of their children in her custody. ",
    "That night, Dany offers Missandei the chance to return to Naath, but the girl feels safer with her. Dreaming of Daario Naharis, Dany hopes that the sellsword will remain loyal to her. Dany goes to take a bath on her terrace, when she is surprised by the voice of Quaithe, speaking to her via some magic. \"Hear me, Daenerys Targaryen. The glass candles are burning. Soon comes the pale mare, and after her the others. Kraken and dark flame, lion and griffin, the sun's son and the mummer's dragon. Trust none of them. Remember the Undying. Beware the perfumed seneschal.\" After telling her to remember who she is, Quaithe is gone. As the sun rises, Dany breaks her fast and prepares for court. ",
    "At court she gazes suspiciously at Reznak mo Reznak - could he be a traitor? Hizdahr zo Loraq pleads for the seventh time for the reopening of the fighting pits, this time cunningly presenting former fighters who themselves willingly ask to be returned to combat. She promises to consider all they have said and then ends the session. ",
    "Barristan Selmy relates how he escaped from King's Landing and Joffrey's guards, and defends Eddard Stark when Daenerys angrily denounces him as a traitor, asserting that Stark argued against having her killed in the small council. Dany asks to see her dragons: Rhaegal and Viserion have been chained up in a pit since the killing of the little girl Hazzea, but Drogon could not be taken and was last seen flying off north to the Dothraki Sea.
