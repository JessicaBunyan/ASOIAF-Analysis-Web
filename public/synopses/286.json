    "As the Merry Midwife arrives in White Harbor, Davos notices that the city is newly fortified. He is initially hopeful that he may be able to persuade Lord Wyman Manderly to ally with King Stannis - until he sees the Lionstar, a warship bearing King Tommen's standard, docked at the harbor. ",
    "He takes in the sights and smells of White Harbor, walking through the Seal Gate. He takes up a place at the Lazy Eel, a shady tavern, and listens to gossip as he tries to work out what the Manderlys will do. He finds out that the Freys have come to White Harbor with the bones of Ser Wendel Manderly and proposals of marriage for Lord Manderly's granddaughters and that his other son, Ser Wylis Manderly, is held captive by the Lannisters. He comes across a Braavosi oarsman who has heard of how Daenerys was attempting to book a passage from Qarth with her three dragons. Davos realizes there is little hope for his mission but he decides he has a duty to try. Approaching the New Castle, he shows them his seals as Stannis' King's Hand, demanding to see Lord Wyman Manderly. "
