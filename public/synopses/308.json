    "The Arya impostor, Jeyne Poole, is preparing for her marriage to Ramsay Bolton, out of fear more than anything. Theon reminds her that she should think of herself as Arya Stark at all times in order to avoid the dangers of enraging Ramsay. Her plight moves Theon considerably. ",
    "Theon has been chosen to ceremoniously present \"Arya\" in marriage to Ramsay, since he was the longtime ward of Eddard Stark and it is widely believed that Arya's trueborn brothers are dead. Jon Snow is a bastard half-brother and while Theon believes Bran and Rickon Stark to be alive, he does not dare to reveal that. ",
    "Meanwhile, Winterfell is suffering from both a hard white frost and the looming menace of the coming of Stannis Baratheon's troops. Even so, Ramsay marries Fake Arya in the godswood. A bard by the name of Abel arrives uninvited, with six women followers, to perform for the wedding.[1] Theon believes that he hears his name (\"Theon\") whispered by the godswood, after months of thinking of himself only as Reek. That and the memories of a different life in a far livelier Winterfell shake him deeply. ",
    "After the marriage, there is a banquet with many northern guests, including Lord Wyman Manderly, who is particularly pleased with the meal. Lady Barbrey Dustin engages in a surprisingly frank conversation with Theon about her mistrust of the Boltons and of the maesters of the Citadel. ",
    "Ramsay calls for Theon and cruelly humiliates both him and the fake Arya (Jeyne) in his quarters. "
