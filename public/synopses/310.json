    "Jon sends Val to the north, to find Tormund Giantsbane and offer him and his followers shelter south of the Wall. Bowen Marsh, Septon Cellador, and Othell Yarwyck talk to Jon with various complaints; they disapprove of Leathers as Castle Black's master-at-arms, Satin as Jon's steward and his decision to negotiate with Tormund and allow him and his men through the Wall. They are also nervous about the fact Jon is keeping two corpses in the ice cells, and react with outrage and horror when Jon reveals he is waiting for them to rise, ignoring Jon's argument that the Watch knows next to nothing about the wights or their masters, and need to learn more if they are to defeat them. Overlooking their protests, Jon tells them of a large group of wildlings making for Hardhome at the east coast north of the Wall, following the witch Mother Mole who claims they will find ships there to bring them across the Narrow Sea. Jon fears they will die there, but when he gets only indifference from the others at the prospect of thousands of dead wildlings, Jon finally loses patience. Angrily asking if they don't realise the truth or are just ignoring it, Jon points out that if they do nothing, the wildlings at Hardhome will die in their thousands, and when they are dead, in time they will rise up again with blue eyes and cold hands, and the Others will have thousands more wights under their control to send at the Wall.
