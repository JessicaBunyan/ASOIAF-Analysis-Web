    "All remaining crewmen and passengers of the Selaesori Qhoran are sold into slavery in a Yunkish camp near Meereen. Tyrion and Penny are sold together to Yezzan zo Qaggaz, an immensely fat Yunkish (though a Westerosi sellsword tries hard to buy them-Tyrion suspects this is because the sellsword knows him and wants to claim Cersei's bounty on his head) and put under the charge of his retainer called Nurse. ",
    "Tyrion sees Jorah Mormont brought on the auction block behind them. The knight tried to fight off the slavers and was beaten almost to the point of death, his face is so swollen as to be almost unrecognizable. Tyrion convinces Nurse that Mormont is an essential part of their show and needs to be bought too. Jorah fought bravely, killing three of the slavers, before being captured and beaten so severely. The fight went out of him once he heard that Daenerys had wed Hizdahr zo Loraq. ",
    "Once purchased, they are brought to Yezzan's pavilion, where they meet some of his other \"treasures\" and his most prized possession Sweets, a hermaphrodite. They are also fitted with slave collars, which Tyrion does not mind as he observes that collars can be removed. There they find out that the sellsword who also tried to buy them was Brown Ben Plumm of the Second Sons. In the evening, Tyrion and Penny are summoned to perform a joust for the guests of Yezzan, including the Yunkish supreme commander Yurkhaz zo Yunzak. The joust is well received, following which they are to pour wine and water for the guests. One of the men heard Tyrion's boast of his skill at cyvasse. Tyrion plays against him and wins, angering the man. He also plays Ben Plumm as his master bets on him; he wins four of five matches, and earns much gold for his master. ",
    "As a reward for their great jousting performance, Yezzan announces they are to repeat it in the Great Pit of Daznak in front of tens of thousands of people. "
