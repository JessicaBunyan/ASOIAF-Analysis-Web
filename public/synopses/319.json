    "Jaime lifts the siege at Raventree Hall. On his way to Riverrun and King's Landing, he encounters Brienne of Tarth. ",
    "Jaime arrives at Raventree Hall, under siege by Jonos Bracken. The siege here is much smaller than the one at Riverrun as the intentions are not to storm the castle but rather to starve them out. The siege has been going on for six months and there is not much hope of rescue for Tytos Blackwood as it is only a matter of time. ",
    "Jaime meets first with Lord Jonos who is in an intimate position with Hildy. After she leaves, Jaime inquires as to what Jonos seeks from the situation. Jonos insists on acquiring a quarter of the House Blackwood lands, saying that they were stolen from them long ago, and that Tywin Lannister promised them to Jonos if he subdued the Blackwoods. Jaime chides the Bracken man saying that they were once an enemy of the king when they sided with the Starks, and keeping his head is more than enough compensation for what the Mountain did to his lands. Bracken protests that he will keep faith with the crown as he did with the Starks; Jonos adds that a dozen good men of his died at the Red Wedding with Robb Stark and he bent the knee because he saw no point in fighting on for a lost cause. Jaime remarks that Lord Jonos is a prudent man on hearing this, yet privately thinks Blackwood might be considered more honorable. ",
    "Jaime then goes to parley with Tytos Blackwood. Inside he sees the castle's massive weirwood tree from which the castle derives its name; the tree is black and leafless. Tytos tells Jaime that it is the fault of the Brackens, poisoned and barren for a thousand years, and in another thousand it will turn to stone as weirwoods never rot. As they treat, Jaime tells him that he does not have to physically kneel to him. They agree to a confession, fealty, pardon, and financial sum as well as lands. Finally they discuss the matter of a hostage, and Jaime asks for Bethany, his daughter, but Tytos refuses as she is his only daughter. They eventually agree to sending Hoster as he is a bookish boy who may enjoy his time in King's Landing and all the books there. Jaime then leaves quickly as he has appointments in Riverrun and King's Landing. The boy is ready to leave with him within an hour. Before departing, he meets Ser Jonos to tell him the resolution, but also informs him that a daughter of his is to attend to the queen in the capital, as she too is to be a hostage. ",
    "Jaime rides to the village Pennytree with Hoster, who tells him of the history of the lands and animosity between the Blackwoods and Brackens. In the village stands an ancient oak tree with pennies nailed to it, the namesake of the village. There, Brienne of Tarth finds them, bandaged on her face, and with the sword Oathkeeper. Brienne claims that she has found Sansa, and that Jaime must accompany her alone or else Sandor Clegane will kill the girl. "
