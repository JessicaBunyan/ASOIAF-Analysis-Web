    "Tyrion has made an agreement with Ben Plumm to join the Second Sons. He signs a number of agreements that he will pay about 50 higher ranking members of the company 100 gold dragons. This amount increases for the higher ranking officers, and for Plumm himself, he must sign a contract for 100,000 dragons along with land and a lordship. After this, he signs the register of the Second Sons using his own blood as ink. ",
    "After this, he is told to go and find armor for himself and Penny. He returns to where she is sleeping, and there he notices signs that she may have the bloody flux. Regardless, she is distraught over the abandonment of the hog and the dog that were part of her show. Tyrion is hiding from her that the two animals have almost definitely been slaughtered by Yezzan zo Qaggaz's men. While they are looking for armor, they find Jorah Mormont outfitted in a random assortment of armor, which he claims is of decent quality. When Penny tells Tyrion that she dreamt that she was jousting with her brother again, Tyrion slaps her, trying to force her to quit her mooning and to realize that they must wear armor or likely die. Finally, Tyrion says that he will take care of making sure that the Second Sons turn sides again, since Tyrion and Jorah both agree that they are on the losing side of the coming battle. "
