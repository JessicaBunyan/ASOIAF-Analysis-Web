    "Jon means to lead men to Hardhome to rescue the wildlings and men of the Night's Watch trapped there. Queen Selyse and Melisandre discourage him, and want to leave them to their fate. However, Jon is determined to lead a rescue mission. ",
    "While planning the mission with Tormund Giantsbane, Jon receives a letter from Ramsay Bolton. Ramsay claims that King Stannis is dead after a seven day battle, that he captured Mance Rayder and flayed his spear wives, and that he wants his bride back, along with Theon, Melisandre, Val, Mance's presumed son, and Queen Selyse and her daughter ",
    "This changes everything, and Jon decides to send the bulk of the Night's Watch to Hardhome with Tormund in command, while he will go to Winterfell himself and make Ramsay answer for his words. Jon knows that doing so will break his vow to not interfere in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms, so he is prepared to go alone. He asks if anyone will ride with him and he gets an overwhelming roar of support from most of the wildlings, though not from his Black Brothers - Yarwyck and Bowen Marsh leave the hall with their men. Jon doesn't mind as he appears to have more than enough men to go with him and none of the Night's Watch will have to break their vows. ",
    "When Jon is on his way to inform Queen Selyse, he hears the giant Wun Wun roar and a man scream. When he arrives, a bleeding Wun Wun is smashing dead Ser Patrek against a tower wall. Jon tries to calm the people who come running, when Wick Wittlestick slashes at Jon's throat with a dagger, just barely grazing him. While Jon is still trying to understand, Bowen Marsh and others plant daggers in him, all of them saying, \"For the Watch.\" By the time the fourth dagger slashes him, Jon passes out. "
