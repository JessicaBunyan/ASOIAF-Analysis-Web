fix headers that got borked by adding css reset

make it so the images never stretch, instead we max it in perspective then roll back to reveal more of the colour 
    - prototype done on max-book-width, 
        -need better colours, or to get a stretchable/repeatable image to use instead to match texture 

Do we want to scroll down to the synopsis every time we click a new chapter? 
    - I think not, need a good way of storing this state

reset button goes missing when offline? Can we save fa icons locally or something to prevent this
new icon for reset button

gaps between bars goes seem weird when zoomed, not all gap look even - "Ice" by Jon

Bars change colour on hover? / cursor: pointer on hover?

shrink the gap between the graph and the synopsis. 
    -This will require writing chapter titles across multiple lines as long titles stretch super far (e.g the princess in the tower) 

refactor graph.js??? might be tricky but would be nice. Some of the calculation can definitely be moved up e.g axis length and scale/tick frequency

refactor css? use LESS? otherwise break css down into base and per-component sytles. Perhaps both

tests? Snapshot tests would be cool.



NORMALISED WORD SCORE
show not just absolute frequency of the word, but a normalised score based upon the total number of words in the chapter/pov
for example Bran has more words than chett in their respective chapters so the absolute scores will always be way off
