implement "back" to go from chapter breakdown to char breakdown

fix headers that got borked by adding css reset

can we do some magic with the images where we never stretch, instead we max it in perspective then roll back to reveal
 more of the colour


Do we want to scroll down to the synopsis every time we click a new chapter?

reset button goes missing when offline? Can we save fa icons locally or something to prevent this
