Need to sort out how to filter by chapter+book

atm filter by chapter groups Jon I ADWD with Jon I AGOT etc. Maybe we put chapterIDs into the JSON


need to decide UI: 
Filter options:
By PoV, By Book, By chapter
Which of these can be used in combination?


I don't think filter by book alone is ever very interesting

filter by char, then by chapter
or filter by book/by chapter

We need to include empty chapters I think. For example Ice => Jaime looks very odd(only jaime 3,7,9)

we don't want to vary the height of the x axis labels if there's enough room
