DEFINITELY DO BEFORE RELEASE
============================

NORMALISED WORD SCORE
show not just absolute frequency of the word, but a normalised score based upon the total number of words in the chapter/pov
for example Bran has more words than chett in their respective chapters so the absolute scores will always be way off.
I think we want to normalised per chapters too so longer chapters aren't overrepresented
So we need to know: total words by PoV, and total words by chapter.

We can then divide total occurrences by this number

stop targ sigil from cropping when the page does expand down (after opening synopsis)

==========================
PROBABLY DO BEFORE RELEASE
==========================

Do we want to scroll down to the synopsis every time we click a new chapter? 
    - I think not, need a good way of storing this state

Bars change colour on hover? / cursor: pointer on hover?
    -If not this then some indication that bars are clickable

shrink the gap between the graph and the synopsis. 
    -This will require writing chapter titles across multiple lines as long titles stretch super far (e.g the princess in the tower) 

long chapter title forces synopsis titles onto 2 lines. abbreviate book name in this case?


=========================
CAN RELEASE WITHOUT THESE
=========================

make it so the images never stretch, instead we max it in perspective then roll back to reveal more of the colour 
    - prototype done on max-book-width, 
        -need better colours, or to get a stretchable/repeatable image to use instead to match texture 

reset button goes missing when offline? Can we save fa icons locally or something to prevent this

gaps between bars goes seem weird when zoomed, not all gap look even - "Ice" by Jon

refactor graph.js??? might be tricky but would be nice. Some of the calculation can definitely be moved up e.g axis length and scale/tick frequency

tests? Snapshot tests would be cool.
