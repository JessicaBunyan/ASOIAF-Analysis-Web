DEFINITELY DO BEFORE RELEASE
============================


Bars change colour on hover?
    -If not this then some indication that bars are clickable

NSFW filter

SOMETHING for mobile/tablet. Even if its just a message

==========================
PROBABLY DO BEFORE RELEASE
==========================

stop targ sigil from cropping when the page does expand down (after opening synopsis)


Do we want to scroll down to the synopsis every time we click a new chapter? 
    - I think not, need a good way of storing this state

shrink the gap between the graph and the synopsis. 
    -This will require writing chapter titles across multiple lines as long titles stretch super far (e.g the princess in the tower) 

long chapter title forces synopsis titles onto 2 lines. abbreviate book name in this case?


=========================
CAN RELEASE WITHOUT THESE
=========================

load the references for a word when you click them rather than frontloading everything

reset button goes missing when offline? Can we save fa icons locally or something to prevent this

gaps between bars goes seem weird when zoomed, not all gap look even - "Ice" by Jon

refactor graph.js??? might be tricky but would be nice. Some of the calculation can definitely be moved up e.g axis length and scale/tick frequency

tests? Snapshot tests would be cool.
